h2. StoryTeller

Imagine a world where developers, testers, and business stakeholders can collaborate with "executable requirements":http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/09/storyteller --
human readable specifications that double as *automated* acceptance and regression tests.  In a nutshell, StoryTeller is an open source tool for creating 
"external DSL's":http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html .  Unlike competing tools, StoryTeller _projects_ the testing input into a human readable form 
instead of parsing text or html to drive the testing machinery.  No messy regex's, no limitations on expressiveness, and the team can still write the necessary testing support
code in whatever .Net language they wish.
